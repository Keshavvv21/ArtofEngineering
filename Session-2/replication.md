# Database Sharding & Replication

## üìå Scale Achievement
Instagram uses **sharding** to manage **billions of photos** across thousands of database nodes, enabling **sub-second query response times globally**.

## üîπ What is Database Sharding?

Database sharding is a **horizontal partitioning technique** that splits large databases into smaller, more manageable pieces called **shards**.  
Each shard is a separate database holding a subset of the data, distributed across multiple servers or data centers.

‚úÖ **Advantages**:  
- Handles scalability limitations of monolithic DBs  
- Distributes both **data storage** and **query processing**  
- Enables **linear scalability** by adding servers (horizontal scaling)

## ‚ö° Sharding Strategies

### üîπ Range-Based Sharding

* Data partitioned by ranges (e.g., User IDs 1‚Äì1000 ‚Üí Shard A, 1001‚Äì2000 ‚Üí Shard B)
* ‚úÖ Simple, efficient range queries
* ‚ùå Hot spots if uneven data distribution

### üîπ Hash-Based Sharding

* Records assigned to shards using `hash(key) % shard_count`
* ‚úÖ Even distribution
* ‚ùå Range queries span multiple shards

### üîπ Directory-Based Sharding

* A lookup service maps keys ‚Üí shards
* ‚úÖ Flexible & custom logic
* ‚ùå Extra complexity, possible single point of failure

### üîπ Geographic Sharding

* Data partitioned by **location/region**
* ‚úÖ Low latency, compliance with residency laws
* ‚ùå Uneven load, complex cross-region queries

---

## üö® Implementation Challenges

* **Cross-shard queries** ‚Üí Denormalization, caching, distributed query engines
* **Rebalancing** ‚Üí Consistent hashing, automated balancing (MongoDB)
* **Transaction consistency** ‚Üí Two-phase commit, Saga pattern, eventual consistency

## üîé Sharding in Practice

* Instagram shards **user data by UserID** using **consistent hashing**
* Media content uses **geographic sharding**
* Handles **95M posts/day** and **500M+ DAUs** with **<1s latency**

---

## üóÇ Master-Slave Replication

Master-slave replication improves **performance & reliability** by maintaining multiple copies of data.

* **Master** ‚Üí Handles **all writes (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)**
* **Slaves** ‚Üí Replicate master data, handle **reads**

---

## üîÑ Replication Process

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App
    participant Master
    participant Slave1
    participant Slave2

    App->>Master: Write Operation (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)
    Master->>Slave1: Replication Log
    Master->>Slave2: Replication Log
    App->>Slave1: Read Query
    App->>Slave2: Read Query
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Types of Replication

* **Asynchronous** ‚Üí High performance, risk of data loss on failure
* **Semi-synchronous** ‚Üí Balance between speed & consistency
* **Synchronous** ‚Üí Strong consistency, higher latency
* **Geographic** ‚Üí Slaves across regions for **disaster recovery & latency reduction**

## ‚úÖ Example: MySQL Master-Slave Setup

### Master `my.cnf`

```ini
[mysqld]
server-id = 1
log_bin = /var/log/mysql/mysql-bin.log
binlog_do_db = your_database_name
```

### Slave `my.cnf`

```ini
[mysqld]
server-id = 2
read_only = 1
relay_log = /var/log/mysql/mysql-relay-bin.log
```

### SQL on Master

```sql
CREATE USER 'repl_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_secure_password';
GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'repl_user'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
SHOW MASTER STATUS;
```

### SQL on Slave

```sql
STOP SLAVE;
CHANGE MASTER TO
    MASTER_HOST='master_ip',
    MASTER_USER='repl_user',
    MASTER_PASSWORD='your_secure_password',
    MASTER_LOG_FILE='mysql-bin.000001',
    MASTER_LOG_POS=123;
START SLAVE;
SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G;
```

## üåç Real-World Use Case

* **Netflix** ‚Üí Uses **dozens of read replicas globally**
* Ensures **sub-100ms response times** for 200M+ subscribers

---

## üìò Did You Know?

* **Google Spanner** ‚Üí A globally distributed database combining **sharding** + **synchronous replication**
* Provides **SQL + strong consistency** across **continents**

üëâ Would you like me to also **add an advanced SQL section (joins, groupby, orderby with diagrams)** into this same `README.md`, or keep sharding + replication only?
